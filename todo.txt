2. GUTGetCount doesn't work. Maybe it's something about where htree is pointing? It's spitting out also numbers for seemingly correctly added nodes.
3. Add unit test for IntBSTIsMember
4. Add to unit test a check that all the nodes in the tree are in the correct place. (Lower is to left, bigger is to right.)
5. Change the Print function from bool to string and write a unit test that checks that the resulting string is correct?
6. Add a function to delete a node.
