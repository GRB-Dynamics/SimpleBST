1. Add a function to delete a node.
2. Fix function for adding node. (Currently unable to add a second node.)
3. Add to unit test a check that all the nodes in the tree are in the correct place. (Lower is to left, bigger is to right.)
4. Change the Print function from bool to string and write a unit test that checks that the resulting string is correct?
